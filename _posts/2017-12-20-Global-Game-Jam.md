title: Global Game Jam 2018
---

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently I've signed [us](http://www.donkeywhisper.com) up to compete in the [2018 Global Game Jam](http://www.globalgamejam.org). We'll be working with our friends at [Solanimus](http://www.solanimus.com) and [Cortex](http://www.fuquaycoworking.com/cortex) to host a jam site here at [Fuquay Coworking](http://www.fuquaycoworking.com).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you'll be in the Fuquay area the weekend of January 26th - 28th, 2018, feel free to join us: https://www.fuquaycoworking.com/ggj18

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though I've been working on _Project Ova_ more now that school is on break, my coding skills are still pretty rusty. I think this will be a good opportunity to hone them. Although _Project Ova_ is being built with the Unreal Engine, I have no idea what engine/framework I'll be using for the jam and probably won't decide until after the theme has been announced and my team has decided upon a game design.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of poor segues and random topics, I suppose I should take a moment to introduce myself and explain some of those references. 

	<introspection>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is [Gary Reif](https://www.linkedin.com/in/garyreif/) and I work as the lead programmer at [Donkey Whisper Productions](http://www.donkeywhisper.com), where we create _weird and wonderful_ games. Or rather, we will. That's our self-defined purpose. Not our job, not our mission, not even our duty. The creation of games, and all that goes with such an endeavor, is the reason we exist.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't always understand my place in the universe, now I do. I want to help people to experience joy, sorrow, victory, defeat, camaraderie, independence, pressure, support, friendship and loss all within the relatively safe environment which games can provide. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating games is my raison d'etre.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a less philosophical sense, DWP is a game development company founded by some of my friends. We have a lot of ideas and are currently working diligently on our first game (codenamed _Project Ova_). We operate out of the [Fuquay CoWorking](https://www.fuquaycoworking.com) office in Fuquay, NC. The same office also hosts [Solanimus](http://www.solanimus.com), creators of [Signal to Noise: a fantastic procedurally-generated-rhythm-game-turned-space-shooter!](http://www.solanimus.com/games/signal-to-noise) They'll be joining us for the game jam and there may be a whiff of inter-company competition in the air.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owners of Fuquay Coworking are launching their own new service: the [Cortex CoGaming Center](http://www.fuquaycoworking.com/cortex-cogaming-center/), a game technology & development coworking space and learning center. [They have graciously offered to host a local Global Game Jam site for us!](http://www.fuquaycoworking.com/ggj18)

Donkey Whisper Productions also plans to show a demo of _Project OVA_ at the [East Coast Game Conference](http://www.ecgconf.com) in April. Look for us in Indie Alley (hopefully)!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also think that the game jam will work as a sort of team-building exercise for our newborn company. This kind of safe-pressure experience can help us to see how our abilities fit together.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I plan to use this blog to provide regular updates on DWP and our projects. I'll focus on the technical (mostly programming) aspects, and hopefully I can convince some of our other team members to start their own blogs as well.

Okay, I should probably go write some code.
